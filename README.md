In project prediction of wine quality using machine learning

Abstract

Traditionally, wine quality assessment has relied on expert tasting, which can be subjective and inconsistent. This project explores a machine learning approach to predict wine quality using chemical properties such as pH, alcohol content, and acidity. Three main techniques were applied: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and ensemble methods. In supervised learning, models like Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting classified wine quality based on labeled data, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy. Unsupervised learning, using clustering methods like K-Means, identified patterns in the data by grouping wines based on their chemical properties. Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, further improved prediction accuracy and reduced overfitting. The results demonstrate that machine learning provides an efficient and objective alternative for assessing wine quality, helping the wine industry optimize production. Future research could explore deep learning and semi-supervised learning for further advancements.

Introduction
Wine quality is traditionally judged by expert tasting, but this method can be subjective and inconsistent. Machine learning offers a data-driven way to predict wine quality using chemical properties like pH, alcohol content, and acidity.

By analyzing large datasets, machine learning models can uncover patterns and provide consistent predictions. Supervised learning methods, such as Random Forest and SVM, classify wines based on quality scores, while unsupervised techniques, like clustering, reveal natural groupings. Ensemble methods further improve accuracy by combining multiple models.
This study explores how machine learning can enhance wine quality assessment, making it more objective, efficient, and scalable for the wine industry.
